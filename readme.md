Tamagachi Project Readme
Let's use our front-end web development skills to create a "living" pet! We'll use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with our pet.

Requirements
You must have a game object or class for your Tamagotchi, and event listeners/handlers that call methods in your game object or class.

Your application must be deployed on Github Pages. There will be a demo on how to deploy to Github Pages next week. If you want to try before then, check out this resource.

You must build incrementally and make commits as you go. You will be expected to show a commit history that reflects taking careful measured steps and building one feature at a time.

Create a repo for your Tamagotchi pet on github.com NOT on github enterprise.

Make a commit after you finish each of the following

Create an Object or Class (look at your notes on JS Classes if you forgot) for your Tamagotchi

Instantiate your Tamagotchi (If you created a class)

Display a character of your choice on the screen to represent your pet

Display the following metrics for your pet:

Hunger (1-10 scale)
Sleepiness (1-10 scale)
Boredom (1-10 scale)
Age
Add buttons to the screen to feed your pet, turn off the lights, and play with your pet.

Add the ability to name your pet.

Style the page.

Increase your pet's age every x minutes

Increase your pet's Hunger, Sleepiness, and Bored metrics on an interval of your choosing.

You pet should die if Hunger, Boredom, or Sleepiness hits 10.

Morph your pet at certain ages.

Animate your pet across the screen while it's alive.

Extras

...with special powers (extend the class)!

Add anything you can think of... use your imagination!
